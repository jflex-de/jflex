# The generated java file is not the test name
javac-files: DangerousFileName.java

description:
Tests that the emitter emits valid Java code when the file name is dangerous.
If unescaped, the header would be
    // source: path/to/filename\u000AFILE_NAMES_MUST_BE_ESCAPED.flex
Which is strictly equivalent to:
    // source: path/to/filename
    FILE_NAMES_MUST_BE_ESCAPED
    .flex
which doesn't compile.
In particular, on Windows, backslash is use as a path separator, so this problem would be likely.
