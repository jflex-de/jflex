test bug #491095 [Definitions not checked in complement]

When referring to an undeclared definition in a 
complement expression no error is reported

%% 
r = !{s} 
%% 
{r} { .. }

will be accepted, but a NullPointerException is thrown 
when the dfa is constructed as `s' is not defined. 

jflex: -q

jflex-fail: true
