Constructing NFA : NFA is
State 0
  with epsilon in {2, 4, 6}
State 1
  with epsilon in {2, 4, 6}
State 2
  with 1 in {3}
  with 2 in {3}
State[FINAL] 3
State 4
  with 0 in {5}
  with 1 in {5}
State[FINAL] 5
State 6
  with 0 in {7}
  with 1 in {7}
  with 2 in {7}
  with 3 in {7}
State[FINAL] 7


8 states in NFA
Converting NFA to DFA : 
....
DFA is
State 0:
  with 0 in 2
  with 1 in 3
  with 2 in 4
  with 3 in 5
State 1:
  with 0 in 2
  with 1 in 3
  with 2 in 4
  with 3 in 5
State [FINAL] 2:
State [FINAL] 3:
State [FINAL] 4:
State [FINAL] 5:


6 states before minimization, 4 states in minimized DFA
Miniminal DFA is
State 0:
  with 0 in 1
  with 1 in 2
  with 2 in 2
  with 3 in 3
State [FINAL] 1:
State [FINAL] 2:
State [FINAL] 3:
