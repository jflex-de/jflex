description:
Test demonstrating issue #538. 
The scanner, which doesn't recognize surrogate chars in its non-fallback rule,
is fed input text "12345678𐌀" using a spoon-feeding reader that splits the input
between the high and low surrogate chars for "𐌀".  Using the problematic.skeleton.default
(the default skeleton at the time of writing), the scanner will output all input chars
except the "𐌀" because its non-fallback rule doesn't recognize unpaired surrogates.
This test's success just verifies the problem, since the output file excludes the trailing "𐌀".
See SpoonFeedReader.test in this directory for the positive version of this test.
