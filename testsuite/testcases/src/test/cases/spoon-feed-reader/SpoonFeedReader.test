description:
Test demonstrating a fix for issue #538. 
The scanner, which doesn't recognize surrogate chars in its non-fallback rule,
is fed input text "12345678𐌀" using a spoon-feeding reader that splits the input
between the high and low surrogate chars for "𐌀".  Using the fixed.skeleton.default,
the scanner should output all input chars.  This test's success verifies that the
problem is fixed by fixed.skeleton.default.
See SpoonFeedReaderF.test in this directory for the negative version of this test.
