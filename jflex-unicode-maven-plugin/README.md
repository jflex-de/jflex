# Unicode maven plugin

If you are not a JFlex developer, you don't need this plugin.

This plugin fetches Unicode from unicode.org and generate their corresponding Java sources.

Because this process takes time, we have actually checked-in the code in
[jflex/src/main/java/jflex/core/unicode](../jflex/src/main/java/jflex/core/unicode).
