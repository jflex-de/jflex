40 states in NFA
Converting NFA to DFA : 
......
DFA is
State [FINAL] 0:
  with 1 in 2
  with 2 in 3
  with 3 in 4
  with 4 in 5
State [FINAL] 1:
  with 1 in 2
  with 2 in 3
  with 3 in 4
  with 4 in 5
State [FINAL] 2:
  with 1 in 6
State [FINAL] 3:
  with 2 in 7
State [FINAL] 4:
State [FINAL] 5:
  with 4 in 5
State [FINAL] 6:
  with 1 in 6
State [FINAL] 7:
  with 2 in 7


8 states before minimization, 5 states in minimized DFA
Miniminal DFA is
State [FINAL] 0:
  with 1 in 1
  with 2 in 2
  with 3 in 3
  with 4 in 4
State [FINAL] 1:
  with 1 in 1
State [FINAL] 2:
  with 2 in 2
State [FINAL] 3:
State [FINAL] 4:
  with 4 in 4
