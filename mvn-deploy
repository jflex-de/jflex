#
# This script is more than just "mvn -Psonatype-oss-release deploy"
# because of inter-dependencies: the maven plugin depends on the release
# version of the jflex jar, and since that can't be satisfied until the
# jflex jar has been installed, that has to be done first.  Similarly,
# the jflex module depends on the parent POM, so that has to be installed
# before building the jflex module.
