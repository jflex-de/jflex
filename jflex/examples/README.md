# JFlex examples

All examples support multiple build systems:
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Build artifacts are in `target` (in subdirectories depending on their nature)
- [ant](https://ant.apache.org/). We place build artifacts in `build`.
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make). We place build artifacts in `out`.

* cup-lcalc: integration between JFlex and CUP on a simple parser for a arithmetic calculator
