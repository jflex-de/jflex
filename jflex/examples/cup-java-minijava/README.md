# Example from the user manual

This is the [example from the user manual](http://jflex.de/manual.html#Example).

This example does not describe the whole lexical structure of Java programs, but only a small and
simplified part of it (some keywords, some operators, comments and only two kinds of literals).
It also shows how to interface with the LALR parser generator CUP and therefore uses a class `sym`
(generated by CUP), where integer constants for the terminal tokens of the CUP grammar are declared.

For a full implementation of **Java 1.2**, see [cup-java](../cup-java).

## Build, run, test

### Using Maven

    ../../mvnw package

To run the parser:

    java -cp target/cup-java-simplified-1.0.jar:../../../cup/cup/java-cup-11b-20160615.jar JavaParser <inputfile>

or more simply the uberjar version:

    java -jar target/cup-java-simplified-full-1.0.jar <inputfile>
