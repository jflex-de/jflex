   in the rhs of those productions then the productions with those non
   terminals need to be found and those rhs's followed.  This process

   takes places we need to go deeper into the grammar since 'expr' is
   a non terminal.  Whenever a non terminal is encountered on the rhs
   of a production we need to find the rhs of that non terminal until
   there are no more non terminals in the rhs.  So when we finish
