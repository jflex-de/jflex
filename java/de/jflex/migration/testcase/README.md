# Migration of testsuite from Maven to Bazel

**Deprecated** All tests have been migrated.

This is a tool to automate the migration of the test cases
from jflex-testsuite-maven-plugin to bazel.

## How to migrate

Example: To migrate caseless-jflex

### Create a working branch
```sh
git co master
git pull
git co -b bzl-migrate-vaseless-jflex
```

### Run the automatic migration
```
bazel run //java/de/jflex/migration/testcase:migrator -- $(bazel info workspace)/testsuite/testcases/src/test/cases/caseless-jflex
cp -r /tmp/caseless_jflex $(bazel info workspace)/javatests/de/jflex/testcase
```

### Verify the migrated test passes
```
bazel test //javatests/de/jflex/testcase/...
```

# Send for review
```
git commit -a
git push
```
