# JFlex

[JFlex][jflex] is a lexical analyzer generator (also known as scanner generator) for Java.

JFlex takes as input a specification with a set of regular expressions and corresponding actions.
It generates Java source of a lexer that reads input, matches the input against the regular
expressions in the spec file, and runs the corresponding action if a regular expression
matched. Lexers usually are the first front-end step in compilers, matching keywords, comments,
operators, etc, and generating an input token stream for parsers.

JFlex lexers are based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs).
They are fast, without expensive backtracking.


## Usage

For documentation and more information see the [JFlex documentation][jflex-doc]
and the [wiki][wiki].

### Usage with Maven

<a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/de.jflex/jflex/">
  <img alt="Maven central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/de.jflex/jflex.svg" height="20">
</a>

You need [Maven][maven] 3.5.2 or later, and JDK 8 or later.

1. Place grammar files in `src/main/flex/` directory.

2. Extend the project [POM build section][pom-build] with the `maven-jflex-plugin`
  ```xml
    <build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>de.jflex</groupId>
          <artifactId>jflex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>1.8.2</version>
          <executions>
            <execution>
              <goals>
                <goal>generate</goal>
              </goals>
            </execution>
          </executions>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </build>
  ```

3. Voil√†: Java code is produced in `target/generated-sources/` during the `generate-sources` phase
(which happens before the `compile` phase) and included in the compilation scope.

### Usage with ant

You need ant, the binary jflex jar and JDK 8 or later.

1. Define ant task
```xml
<taskdef classname="jflex.anttask.JFlexTask" name="jflex"
         classpath="path-to-jflex.jar"/>
```
2. Use it
```xml
<jflex file="src/grammar/parser.flex" destdir="build/generated/"/>
<javac srcdir="build/generated/" destdir="build/classes/"/>
```

### Usage with Bazel

We provide a [jflex rule](https://jflex-de.github.io/bazel_rules/)

```
load("@jflex_rules//jflex:jflex.bzl", "jflex")

jflex(
    name = "",           # Choose a rule name
    srcs = [],           # Add input lex specifications
    outputs = [],        # List expected generated files
)
```

See the sample [simple BUILD](https://github.com/jflex-de/jflex/blob/master/jflex/examples/simple/BUILD)
file.

### Usage in CLI

You need the binary jflex jar and JDK 8 or later.

You can also use JFlex directly from the command line:
```
jflex/bin/jflex src/grammar/parser.flex
```

Or:
```
java -jar jflex-full-1.8.2.jar -d output src/grammar/parser.flex
```

### Source layout

The top level directory of the JFLex git repository contains:

 * **cup** A copy of the CUP runtime
 * **cup-maven-plugin** A simple Maven plugin to generate a parser with CUP.
 * **docs** the Markdown sources for the user manual
 * **java** Java sources [WIP, Bazel]
 * **javatests** Java sources of test [WIP, Bazel]
 * **jflex** JFlex, the scanner/lexer generator for Java
 * **jflex-maven-plugin** the JFlex maven plugin, that helps to integrate JFlex in your project
 * **jflex-unicode-plugin** the JFlex unicode maven plugin, used for compiling JFlex
 * **testsuite** the regression test suite for JFlex,
 * **third_party** third-party librairies used by examples of the [Bazel build system][bazel]


### Build from source

#### Build with Bazel

JFlex can be built with Bazel.
[Migration to Bazel][migration-bazel] is still work in progress, concerning the test suite, for instance.


You need [Bazel][bazel].

```
bazel build //jflex:jflex_bin
```

This builds `bazel-bin/jflex/jflex_bin`, that you can use

```
bazel-bin/jflex/jflex_bin --info
```

Or:

```
bazel run //jflex:jflex_bin -- --info
```

Build uberjar (aka fatjar aka deploy jar)

```
bazel build jflex/jflex_bin_deploy.jar
```

Continuous integration is done with [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/jflex-de/jflex/master).

#### Build with Maven

You need JDK 8 or later.

```
./mvnw install
```

This generates `jflex/target/jflex-full-1.9.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` that you can use, e.g.

```
java -jar jflex-full-1.9.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --info
```

Continuous Integration is made with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/jflex-de/jflex/branches).
